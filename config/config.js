At Realogy, I provided leadership as a subject matter expert on best practices and developed an intranet for technical documentation of development tools and APIs. I was the Lead Developer at a large construction and real estate development company, where I developed highly dynamic websites and applications for residential and commercial properties using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, PHP, WordPress, Angular, custom WordPress PHP plugins, and contact forms. I then worked for an IT Managed Service Provider as a Full Stack Web Developer, developing responsive single-page web applications and dashboards for mobile and desktop, APIs, system integrations, and browser extensions to optimize CRM workflows using JavaScript, Express.js, Node.js, Axios, React, CSS, Bootstrap, and Chakra.",
