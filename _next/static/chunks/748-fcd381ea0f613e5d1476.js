Proficient in JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, React, Node.js, and modern frameworks like Next.js and Angular, I specialize in delivering end-to-end solutions that drive business impact. My expertise spans front-end development, back-end systems, API integrations, and leveraging AI tools to optimize workflows, enhance user experiences, and reduce operational costs. Fueled by curiosity and a commitment to lifelong learning, I continuously explore emerging technologies and methodologies to push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible.","My career began in IT engineering at KPMG and system administration at Novartis, where I honed my technical foundation. Transitioning to software development at Realogy, I led the development of LeadRouter, a web-based real estate lead management tool used by millions of agents to route leads, streamlining sales processes and improving conversion rates by 20%. At OLM Foods (now part of Performance Food Group), I spearheaded transformative digital solutions, including RightBytes, a scalable e-commerce food ordering platform for web, iOS, and Android. I optimized PHP and Node.js backend APIs, integrated Stripe, PayPal, and DoorDash, and developed a WooCommerce-based B2B portal with SAP integrations, reducing server costs by 50% and improving order processing efficiency by 25%. I also led the development of TaskBytes, an AI-powered food service compliance automation tool that uses predictive analytics to optimize purchasing and production schedules, reducing waste by up to 18%.","Currently at Satmo, a Bitcoin startup, I'm building the future of decentralized payments by developing comprehensive Lightning Network payment integrations across major e-commerce platforms. I architected and implemented payment gateway plugins for WordPress/WooCommerce, Wix, and Shopify, enabling merchants to accept instant Bitcoin Lightning payments with minimal setup. These solutions integrate with custom ACINQ/phoenixd backends, feature real-time exchange rates, automatic payment verification, webhook security tokens, QR code generation, and seamless user experiences. I also work on the Satmo B2C mobile app with a team of developers, a React Native application built with Expo and TypeScript that enables users to send and receive Lightning payments, scan QR codes, integrate with merchant platforms and Strike, and features biometric authentication and push notifications. By leveraging modern technologies like Next.js, React, Node.js, and TypeScript, I'm helping merchants worldwide accept Bitcoin payments while providing users with intuitive mobile payment experiences.","A passionate Bitcoin advocate and innovator, I'm dedicated to advancing Lightning Network adoption through my work at Satmo and by contributing to open-source Bitcoin projects. In 2022, I founded the Jersey City Bitcoin Meetup, which hosts monthly Socratic seminar Bitcoin education meetups, fostering community learning and discussion. I run a Lightning Network node, actively mentor aspiring developers through coding bootcamps and meetups, and share expertise on Bitcoin and Lightning Network technology. My commitment to clean code principles and continuous learning\u2014evidenced by certifications from Scrimba's Frontend Developer Bootcamp and Free Code Camp's comprehensive development courses\u2014drives my ability to deliver cutting-edge solutions.
